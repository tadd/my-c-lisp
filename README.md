My C Lisp
=========

A study or an Ã©tude for my daily hacking exercise, a Scheme engine that aims[^1] for
[R<sup>5</sup>RS](https://conservatory.scheme.org/schemers/Documents/Standards/R5RS/)
compliance.

You'll find nothing unique or interesting here; this is an interpreter with a plain and
old C implementation (C17 with some extensions).

You can use this under the [MIT license](./LICENSE.md).

[^1]: just a little[^2] bit
[^2]: really
