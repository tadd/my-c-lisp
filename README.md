Schaf
=====

A [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/) engine that aims[^1] for
[R<sup>5</sup>RS](https://conservatory.scheme.org/schemers/Documents/Standards/R5RS/)
compliance. Also, a study or an Ã©tude for my daily hacking exercise.

You'll find nothing unique or interesting here; this is just one of those plain and
old-fashioned interpreters in C (C17 with some extensions).

## Why that name?

* Both "Scheme" and "Schaf" begin with `Sch`. So we can use the prefix `sch_` for our
  exported symbols in both senses.
* [It](https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Schaf)'s like me who got lost.
