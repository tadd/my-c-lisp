My C Lisp
=========

A study or an Ã©tude for my daily hacking exercise, a
[Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/) engine that aims[^1] for
[R<sup>5</sup>RS](https://conservatory.scheme.org/schemers/Documents/Standards/R5RS/)
compliance.

You'll find nothing unique or interesting here; this is just one of those plain and
old-fashioned interpreters in C (C17 with some extensions).

You can use this under the [MIT license](./LICENSE.md).

Our milestones will be available at the
[project page](https://github.com/users/tadd/projects/3).

[^1]: just a little[^2] bit
[^2]: really
